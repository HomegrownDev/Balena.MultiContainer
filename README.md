# MultiContainer with WiFi Connect
### Balena OS Based

WiFi connect is a product by Balena that allows your connected Raspberry Pi or supported board to act as an access point so that you can set credentials for the WiFi network you'd like your PI to connect to. The files for this are included in this repo. the `/Wifi-Connect` directory is the source files for the WiFi connect product. The `/containers` directory is for the **Dockerfile**, or in the case of more complex instances, **Compose** files, necessary for the consistent, dependable, and repeatable deployment of the containers.
